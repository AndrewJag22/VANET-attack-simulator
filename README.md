# Position Forging Attacks in VANET -- Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks
This project is inspired by Jyoti Grover, et al. titled 'Position Forging Attacks in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks: Implementation, Impact and Detection'

The goal of this project was to create a simple simulation of the different classes of position forging attacks that a VANET is susceptible to.
